## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.


### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] In variables.py, Z should be defined according to the instructions given in the practical guide

- [ ] In Collatz.py, you use a bit of pseudocode, but it could be used more effectively to document your code. What is the main idea of what your script does? 

- [ ] The answer for the mystery code is almost correct. But it only outputs one number, so how can it "find the prime numbers" between 0 and 99?

- [ ] In the "powers of 2" exercise, you should use pseudocode to document your CODE()

### Feedback Week 5:

The code for week 5 is great. There is no need to change anything.
